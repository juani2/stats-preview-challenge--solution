## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Graceful degradation workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I was able to learn how to analyze image-only designs and analyze it in order to code the design much easier. As of my current level, I wasn't able to achieve a pixel perfect implementation of the challenge.

My flexbox and media query skills were put to test.
In this challenge, I found out that flexbox and media query can enhance user experience
by altering size, alignment and order based on the currently available screen real estate.

### Continued development
My current implementation was still far from the target design.
I still need to enhance my skill in analyzing and identifying the right combination of font-size and white spaces.

Also, the current implementation is not flexible and extensible.
Maybe I could improve the code by applying BEM principles but as of now, I need further practice.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site really helped me in digesting core HTML/CSS principles
